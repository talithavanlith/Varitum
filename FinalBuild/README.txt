Varitum is a physics based puzzle-platformer game. You are a space cadet who has crash landed on a foreign planet, armed only with a high tech gun which can manipulate the effect of gravity on inanimate objects. Navigate across the planet using your gravity gun to overcome obstacles, make it to an escape pod, and return home.

Controls:
	- Move: A/D
	- Jump: W / Space
	- Shoot: Left click
	- Change gravity effect direction: Mouse scroll wheel
	- Pause / menu: Esc
	- Restore checkpoint: R

Known Issues:
	- The player's animation very rarely becomes desynced. The legs are at a weird angle when the player is idle, instead of pointing down. This issue is resolved on player respawn.
	- Shooting the top or bottom edge of a reflector sometimes causes the shot to reflect at an unexpected angle.      
	- The first vine in the game rarely gets stuck in its idle state. This issue is resolved on player respawn.
	- The collider of the animated vines is not always pixel perfect when the vine is moving upwards. It may look like the player touched the vine but it won't kill them. This issue, however, always works in favour of the player :)
